    <p class="body-1">A Platonic Solid is a 3D shape that is made up of regular polygons with the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. They are named after Greek Philosopher Plato.</p>
    <p class="body-1">Unlike in 2D, where there are infintely many regular polygons, in 3D there are only 5 called the Platonic Solids. These are the tetrahedron (d4), the cube (d6), the octahedron (d8), the docecahedron (d12) and the icosahedron (d20).</p>
    <p class="body-1">The tetrahedron (d4) is made up of 4 regular triangles in the shape of a pyramid. It has 4 faces and vertices and 6 edges.</p>
    <p class="body-1">The cube (d6) is made up of 6 regular rectangles (squares) in the shape of a box. It has 6 faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges.</p>
    <p class="body-1">The octahedron (d8) is made up of 8 regular triangles in the shape of a crystal. It has 8 faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges.</p>
    <p class="body-1">The dodecahedron (d12) is made up of 12 regular pentagons. It has 12 faces, 20 vertices, and 30 edges.</p>
    <p class="body-1">The icosahedron (d20) is made up of 20 regular triangles. It has 20 faces, 12 verticies, and 30 edges.</p>
    <p class="body-1">The pentagonal trapezoid (d10) is not a platonic solid. However, it is grouped in RPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons with the other Platonic Solids to form the basic set of dice. Hence why the word "Platonic" is quoted in the app.</p>
    <p class="body-1">The pentagonal trapezoid (d10) is made up of 10 kites. It has 10 faces, 12 verticies, and 20 edges.</p>
