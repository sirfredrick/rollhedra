    <p class="body-1">Rollhedra takes a mathematical twist to the normal dice rolling web-app. It categorizes dice by their geometric properties. It includes subgroups of what are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Rarer_variations">"Uniform Fair Dice"</a> meaning that mathematically each side should have an equal chance of being rolled. This is due to them being symmetrical or face-transitive.</p>
    <p class="body-1">These subgroups are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">Platonic Solids</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_solid">Catalan Solids</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipyramid">Bipyramids</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezohedron">Trapezohedra</a>.</p>
    <p class="body-1">Rollhedra is built using <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue JS</a> and <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com">Vuetify</a> and features responsive design to fit on both mobile and desktop configurations. It also supports <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a>  Web Panels so you can roll your dice while looking up character or enemy stats at the same time.</p>
